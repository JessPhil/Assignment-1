So delaying our investment each day is a lost opportunity.The Time Value of Money(TMV) is an important principle in the field of finance. The three main reasons for TMV is inflation, risk and liquidity. Therefore, it is always crucial for an investor to understand this concept and decide to invest money in his hand today to earn interest or capital gains."
